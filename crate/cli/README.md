# vlajmaji-cli

The `vlajmaji` JSON command for [Vlajmaji](https://github.com/oxur/vlajmaji)'s dictionary workbench.

For the 0.2.0 development checkout, run these commands from the workspace root
with Bauske checked out alongside Vlajmaji:

```sh
make build
./bin/vlajmaji --help
```

Use `make build-release` for an optimized build, or override `INSTALL_DIR` to
choose where the binary is copied. The published 0.1.0 package still installs
the previous `relojban-search` command.

Requires Rust 1.98 or newer. Commands build a new SQLite store directory from a lexical archive, report corpus counts, and accept query JSON through an argument or standard input. Compound analysis and generation are enabled in the CLI.

Corpus data is not bundled. See the [data and replay guide](https://github.com/oxur/vlajmaji/blob/main/docs/migration.md) for the current research-input workflow. Licensed under Apache-2.0.
